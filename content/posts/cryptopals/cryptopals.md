  ---Last weekend I had the most wonderful discovery. I stumbled across Cryptopals, a site filled with Cryptography based problem solving questions.

This discovery wasn't entirely accidental as over the past week I've been feeding my interest in Cybersecurity through soaking up different books obtained from Humble Bundle on the topic such as: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Security-Engineering-Building-Dependable-Distributed/dp/0470068523/ref=asc_df_0470068523/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310831942794&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4793431657311527403&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007850&hvtargid=pla-466237700385&psc=1&th=1&psc=1"> Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems by Ross J. Anderson </a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Certified-Ethical-Hacker-Study-Guide/dp/1119533198/ref=asc_df_1119533198/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=375426022936&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2006162878877837479&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007850&hvtargid=pla-547569413451&psc=1&th=1&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=76471991986&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=375426022936&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2006162878877837479&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007850&hvtargid=pla-547569413451">The Certified Ethical Hacker Study Guide by Sean-Philip Oriyan </a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470/ref=asc_df_1118026470/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310913487979&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11160321859221943564&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007850&hvtargid=pla-490871754939&psc=1&th=1&psc=1"> The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Flaws by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto. </a> The security realm of technology has been an enduring interest of mine and I remember back to my summer internship at AWS, when I would treat myself to DEFCON youtube videos and listening to <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/"> The Darknet Diaries </a> podcast when I needed to distract my mind away from the technical problems I was dealing with (I would highly recommend this to any of my readers!)

This site is great for those of us who love problem-solving and doing background research and reading to fully understand the arithmetic and reasoning behind how different cryptographic algorithms work. Currently I'm on the first set of problems so they aren't necessarily mind bending, but nonetheless the challenges are forcing me to think in a new way and gain exposure to cryptography and statistics. It's also a great way of gaining familiarity with a new language. I started out doing the challenges in Golang but now lean towards completing the challenges in Python.

I might write a blogpost centered around my solutions to the problems but I find the site itself and other contributors to the challenges have already done a damn good job at achieving such a deep dive.
