# About me

Hi there! My name is Aideen and I'm an Irish redhead studying my final year of Computer Engineering at Trinity College Dublin.

I just love learning and playing with new technologies to see what I can build with them. I'm working to equip myself with the skills that enable me to make a difference :)

I hope you enjoy some of my posts documenting my journey through final year into the tech industry and what I'm learning along the way - from neural networks, systems performance to the deployment, automation and management of services and applications. Expect to see Kubernetes ... a lot.

The question of how we serve an application or service in the safest, most reliable and performant way is super interesting to me.

Have fun
