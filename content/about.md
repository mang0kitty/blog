# About me

Hi there! My name is Aideen and I’m an Irish redhead studying my final year of Computer Engineering at Trinity College Dublin.

I’m very interested in how to bridge the gap between software and systems engineering to better build reliable and fault-tolerant distributed systems in a world of always-on applications and API’s. I want to be involved in the wider adoption and gaining popularity of containers, container images and container orchestrators to be used as a foundation for building systems efficiently with the required level of agility, scale and reliability.

This blog is a way for me to share what I'm learning and maybe help others along the way if we end up solving similar probelms. I love learning and playing with new technologies to see what I can build with them or what problem I can solve. I'm working to equip myself with the skills that enable me to make a difference :) I’m an avid reader and I’ll share any gems I find with you throughout my posts! Brendan Burns “Distributed Systems” and Brendan Greg’s “System Performance” have been two of my favourite discoveries this summer.

For a little context of what I'm doing currently, I’m working on a project to automate the parallel alignment of DNA using Kubernetes jobs. This project Is to reduce the technical-overhead and time taken for geneticists to perform a BWBBLE alignment job using modern job orchestration tools and patterns paired with a simple and easy to use interface for the geneticists to interact with. This project presents challenging problems like managing the security implications of using Kubernetes and how does the runtime of the program scale? I’ll have to evaluate the runtime configurations for performance with the help of benchmarking and monitoring tools I’ll put into place like Grafana and Prometheus. It also offers an opportunity to deep dive on compression algorithms like the Burrows-Wheeler Transform and how these can be used to improve our experience of the internet as a whole.

This year I’ve been studying Deep Learning and it's set of powerful techniques for learning in neural networks, which are a beautiful biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data. This will be another area I'll most likely share if managing my containers doesn't get too out of hand!

That’s all for now.

Have fun,

Aideen Fay
